# What?
This is a very meh and random flappy bird clone using Rust with the Bevy engine.
# Why?
I made this purely out of boredom and to see how it'd go.
# How to build
* Have Rust installed
* Run in command panel when it is in the same directory: `cargo build --release --features no_log`
* When it is complete it'll be located in `target/release`
